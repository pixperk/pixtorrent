# PixTorrent

A high-performance, distributed peer-to-peer file sharing system implementing core BitTorrent protocol concepts in Go. This project demonstrates advanced distributed systems engineering through a complete P2P stack featuring tracker-based peer discovery, custom binary protocols, and intelligent swarm coordination.

## Architecture Overview

PixTorrent implements a layered P2P architecture with the following core components:

- **Centralized Tracker**: Redis-backed peer discovery and torrent statistics aggregation
- **Binary Wire Protocol**: Custom BitTorrent-inspired messaging with efficient piece transfer
- **Swarm Intelligence**: Distributed coordination for optimal piece distribution strategies
- **Transport Layer**: High-performance TCP multiplexing with connection pooling

The system demonstrates advanced concepts in distributed computing, network programming, and concurrent systems design.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.19+ (with modules support)
- Docker & Docker Compose (Redis dependency)
- Unix-like environment (Linux/macOS/WSL)

### Deployment

1. **Repository setup:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pixperk/pixtorrent.git
   cd pixtorrent
   go mod tidy
   ```

2. **Initialize Redis backend:**
   ```bash
   make dkr
   ```

3. **Launch tracker service:**
   ```bash
   make run-tracker
   ```
   Tracker HTTP server binds to `localhost:8080`

4. **Start P2P network simulation:**
   ```bash
   make run
   ```

This initializes a 3-node P2P network with automatic peer discovery, piece distribution, and file reconstruction. The system demonstrates real-world P2P behavior including handshake negotiation, bitfield synchronization, and distributed chunk assembly.

## How It All Works

## Protocol Implementation

### Tracker Protocol (HTTP/Bencode)

The tracker implements the BitTorrent tracker specification with HTTP endpoints for peer coordination and statistics aggregation:

**Announce Protocol** - Peer lifecycle management:
```bash
# Peer registration and discovery
curl "http://localhost:8080/announce?info_hash=HASH&peer_id=PEER123&port=6881&uploaded=0&downloaded=0&left=1024&event=started"

# Download completion notification
curl "http://localhost:8080/announce?info_hash=HASH&peer_id=PEER123&port=6881&uploaded=1024&downloaded=1024&left=0&event=completed"

# Periodic state synchronization
curl "http://localhost:8080/announce?info_hash=HASH&peer_id=PEER123&port=6881&uploaded=512&downloaded=256&left=768"
```

**Scrape Protocol** - Torrent metrics aggregation:
```bash
# Swarm statistics query
curl "http://localhost:8080/scrape?info_hash=HASH"
```

The tracker returns bencode-encoded responses containing peer lists, interval timing, and swarm statistics for optimal peer selection.

### Peer Wire Protocol

The peer-to-peer layer implements a custom binary protocol for efficient piece transfer and swarm coordination:

1. **Connection Establishment**: TCP handshake with protocol negotiation and info hash validation
2. **Capability Exchange**: Bitfield synchronization for piece availability mapping
3. **Request Pipeline**: Asynchronous piece request/response cycles with flow control
4. **Data Transfer**: Raw binary chunk transmission with integrity verification
5. **State Synchronization**: Real-time piece availability updates across the swarm

### Message Frame Format

The protocol defines a compact message structure for minimal network overhead:

```
| Message Type (1 byte) | Payload Length (variable) | Payload Data |
```

**Core Message Types:**
- `MsgInterested` (0x01) - Peer capability negotiation
- `MsgRequestPiece` (0x02) - Piece download request with index
- `MsgSendPiece` (0x03) - Piece data transmission
- `MsgHave` (0x04) - Piece availability announcement
- `MsgBitfield` (0x05) - Complete piece availability map
- `MsgChoke/Unchoke` (0x06/0x07) - Flow control signaling

## Scaling and Network Topology

The system supports horizontal scaling through distributed peer addition:

### Adding Network Nodes

**Programmatic Scaling:**
```go
// Extend the transport configuration matrix
tcpOpts := []p2p.TCPTransportOpts{
    {ListenAddr: "127.0.0.1:3000", InfoHash: infoHash, /* ... */},
    {ListenAddr: "127.0.0.1:4000", InfoHash: infoHash, /* ... */},
    {ListenAddr: "127.0.0.1:5000", InfoHash: infoHash, /* ... */},
    {ListenAddr: "127.0.0.1:6000", InfoHash: infoHash, /* ... */}, // New peer
}

// Instantiate corresponding server with dedicated piece manager
pm4 := p2p.NewPieceManager(numPieces)
server4 := torrentserver.NewTorrentServer(serverOpts, pm4)
```

**Network Discovery:**
Peers automatically discover each other through tracker announce cycles. The system implements connection deduplication and maintains a distributed hash table of active peer connections for optimal routing.

### Performance Characteristics
